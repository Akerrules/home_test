This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

Prerequisites Before running the project, ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:

Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download the latest version from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

```bash
code npm -v
```

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
```

Install flask and other python modules:

```bash
cd api
pip install flask
pip install joblib
pip install numpy
pip install sklearn
pip install scikit-learn
```

Then run the python application and return to root:

#On Windows:

```bash
python app.py
```

#On Mac/UNIX:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

cd ..
Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
